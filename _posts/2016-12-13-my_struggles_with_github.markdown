I've never done any command line work before, and this was not a good first impression. Most of the time, while trying to submit my work to github using the learn terminal, it would crash and I struggled to successful update. I'm using a Windows desktop, so sorry Mac users, I'm a gamer too. But, this seemed to make things worse in regards to the ease of finding a terminal that would work well with my machine. Finally, I ended up just using git shell, but in the process seem to mess everything up with the link to Learn. However, for the last few weeks Learn has been having some issues of its own. Coding is hard, but I feel understanding how the coding world runs with github and the Learn program itself, has been the bigger struggle. I feel like there needs to be a lesson on how best to set up your computer in preperation, like getting a proper text editor and terminal for Macs AND Windows users. Just having a bigger picture of the world fo coding would be great to have. I'm sure some people may completely skip over that, but for me, I needed a basic of all basic background of what was going on. I don't even know how I would begin to tell my grandmother how this all works. Especially because I feel I barely know the tip of the iceberg. I feel like it isn't actually that hard of a topic to understand.  I just never got that education here, that was disappointing.
